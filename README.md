# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects.-
In this read-me file you will see all my C# and .NET Framework projects i have created during this course. Below you will see a list of completed projects and a brief explanation of what they are and my enjoyment of completing them.


# Projects:

# Package express
This was my first task in the C# and .NET Framework - Part 1 course called the Branching assignment. This assignment entailed me creating a console-based application for getting a shipping quote for a package. I had lots of fun making this project as it was putting my C# skills to the test fully.

# Method Class Assignment
This assignment was my introduction to the C# and .NET Framework - Part 2 course. this project was about creating a console-based application that made math operations. this project was very insightful and I had a blast problem solving my way to completion.

# Polymorphism Assignment
This assignment explores the concept of Polymorphism and how we use it in creating console-based applications. The project explores using a  Quit() method, implementing this method in an Employee class, and using polymorphism to call Quit() on an object of type IQuittable. This project was hard to complete.
